    "# CrewAI with Couchbase Short-Term Memory using GSI Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a custom storage backend for CrewAI's memory system using Couchbase and GSI (Global Secondary Index) vector search. GSI vector search provides high-performance semantic search capabilities and is available in Couchbase Server 8.0.0+. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the FTS index, please take a look at [this.](../fts/CouchbaseStorage_Demo.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of each section:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to run this tutorial\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) that you can run \n",
    "interactively. You can access the original notebook here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",
    "- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "- Run it on your system by setting up the Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: GSI vector search requires Couchbase Server 8.0.0+ or Couchbase Capella with Query Service enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up)\n",
    "   - To get started with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com), create an account and use it to deploy \n",
    "     a forever free tier operational cluster\n",
    "   - This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn \n",
    "     about Capella with no time constraint\n",
    "   - To learn more, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) \n",
    "     used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)\n",
    "   - Ensure Query Service is enabled on your cluster for GSI vector search functionality"

    "# Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory in AI agents is a crucial capability that allows them to retain and utilize information across interactions, making them more effective and contextually aware. Without memory, agents would be limited to processing only the immediate input, lacking the ability to build upon past experiences or maintain continuity in conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This section on memory types and functionality is adapted from the CrewAI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term Memory\n",
    "- Retains recent interactions and context\n",
    "- Typically spans the current conversation or session  \n",
    "- Helps maintain coherence within a single interaction flow\n",
    "- In CrewAI, this is what we're implementing with the Couchbase storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term Memory\n",
    "- Stores persistent knowledge across multiple sessions\n",
    "- Enables agents to recall past interactions even after long periods\n",
    "- Helps build cumulative knowledge about users, preferences, and past decisions\n",
    "- While this implementation is labeled as \"short-term memory\", the Couchbase storage backend can be effectively used for long-term memory as well, thanks to Couchbase's persistent storage capabilities and enterprise-grade durability features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works in Agents\n",
    "Memory in AI agents typically involves:\n",
    "- Storage: Information is encoded and stored in a database (like Couchbase, ChromaDB, or other vector stores)\n",
    "- Retrieval: Relevant memories are fetched based on semantic similarity to current context\n",
    "- Integration: Retrieved memories are incorporated into the agent's reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CrewAI example, the CouchbaseStorage class implements:\n",
    "- save(): Stores new memories with metadata\n",
    "- search(): Retrieves relevant memories based on semantic similarity\n",
    "- reset(): Clears stored memories when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "- Contextual Understanding: Agents can refer to previous parts of a conversation\n",
    "- Personalization: Remembering user preferences and past interactions\n",
    "- Learning and Adaptation: Building knowledge over time to improve responses\n",
    "- Task Continuity: Resuming complex tasks across multiple interactions\n",
    "- Collaboration: In multi-agent systems like CrewAI, memory enables agents to build on each other's work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory in CrewAI Specifically\n",
    "In CrewAI, memory serves several important functions:\n",
    "- Agent Specialization: Each agent can maintain its own memory relevant to its expertise\n",
    "- Knowledge Transfer: Agents can share insights through memory when collaborating on tasks\n",
    "- Process Continuity: In sequential processes, later agents can access the work of earlier agents\n",
    "- Contextual Awareness: Agents can reference previous findings when making decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector-based approach (using embeddings) is particularly powerful because it allows for semantic search - finding memories that are conceptually related to the current context, not just exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing custom storage like Couchbase, you gain additional benefits like persistence, scalability, and the ability to leverage enterprise-grade database features for your agent memory systems."

    "## Understanding GSI Vector Search Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Couchbase offers two types of GSI vector indexes for different use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperscale Vector Indexes (BHIVE)\n",
    "- Best for pure vector searches - content discovery, recommendations, semantic search\n",
    "- High performance with low memory footprint - designed to scale to billions of vectors\n",
    "- Optimized for concurrent operations - supports simultaneous searches and inserts\n",
    "- Use when: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n",
    "- Ideal for: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite Vector Indexes \n",
    "- Best for filtered vector searches - combines vector search with scalar value filtering\n",
    "- Efficient pre-filtering - scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n",
    "- Use when: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n",
    "- Ideal for: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the Right Index Type\n",
    "- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets\n",
    "- Use Composite Vector Index when scalar filters significantly reduce your search space\n",
    "- Consider your dataset size: Hyperscale scales to billions, Composite works well for tens of millions to billions\n",

    "\n",
    "The index_description parameter controls how Couchbase optimizes vector storage and search performance through centroids and quantization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Format: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`\n",

    "Centroids (IVF - Inverted File):\n",
    "- Controls how the dataset is subdivided for faster searches\n",
    "- More centroids = faster search, slower training  \n",
    "- Fewer centroids = slower search, faster training\n",
    "- If omitted (like IVF,SQ8), Couchbase auto-selects based on dataset size\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization Options:\n",
    "- SQ (Scalar Quantization): SQ4, SQ6, SQ8 (4, 6, or 8 bits per dimension)\n",
    "- PQ (Product Quantization): PQ<subquantizers>x<bits> (e.g., PQ32x8)\n",
    "- Higher values = better accuracy, larger index size\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Examples:\n",
    "- IVF,SQ8 - Auto centroids, 8-bit scalar quantization (good default)\n",
    "- IVF1000,SQ6 - 1000 centroids, 6-bit scalar quantization  \n",
    "- IVF,PQ32x8 - Auto centroids, 32 subquantizers with 8 bits\n",
